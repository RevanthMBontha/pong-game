# Pong Game

A basic but fully functional Pong game!

Inspired by the classic game created in 1972 by Allan Alcorn. Tried to recreate the classic 8-bit feel.

Uses [Turtle Graphics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) for the GUI.

### How to Play:
* Download the repository and extract the files.
* Open a Command shell in the folder containing the files.
* Run the following command to start the game:
```python
python main.py
```
* On end, click on the window to close the game.
